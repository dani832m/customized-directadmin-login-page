# Clean DirectAdmin Login Page
Customized Login Page to your DirectAdmin Dashboard. Written in HTML, CSS and with a little JavaScript to display error messages.

## To whom
If you want a clean login page that actually works. Unlike the demo that DirectAdmin presents in their documentation. No logos, no ads. Just pure HTML and CSS.

## Set up to work
1. Replace the value of the action attribute in the form tag with your webhost and port used.
2. Replace the value of the two input tags named **FAIL_URL** and **LOGOUT_URL**.

**That's all!**
